title: "Added another work chunk state to Batch2 jobs: READY.
        This work chunk state will be the initial state work chunks
        are created. After which, they will be picked up by a maintenance
        pass and have their states updated to QUEUED before sending them to
        the queue.
        The exception is for ReductionStep chunks (because reduction steps
        are not read off of the queue, but executed by the maintenance job
        inline.
