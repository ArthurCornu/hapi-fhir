type: fix
issue: 6180
title: "IGenericClients or IHttpClients created to make requests
        would be thrown away and new ones created to make the request
        along the chain.
        This resulted in client settings being lost (since the client
        was lost).
        This hasn't been fixed, since the paths are so well used,
        but a new path has been created to allow reusable clients
        that will reuse the same settings for all subsequent requests.
