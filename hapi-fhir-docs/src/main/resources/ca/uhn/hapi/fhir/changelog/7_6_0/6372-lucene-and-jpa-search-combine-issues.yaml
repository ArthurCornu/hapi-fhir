type: fix
issue: 6372
title: "When Lucene (fulltext search) is combined with jpa search,
        where Lucene would match more results and require jpa search
        to narrow these down based on additional filters, sometimes
        no results would be returned due to a bug in how we combined
        search results from jpa and search results from Lucene.
        This has now been fixed.
"
