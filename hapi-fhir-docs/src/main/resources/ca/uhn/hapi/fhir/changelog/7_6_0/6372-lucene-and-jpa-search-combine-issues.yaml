title: "Sometimes when combining fulltext search filters
        with jpa search filters, no data would be returned,
        even though data matching these filters definitely exists.
        
        This happened because we break up large queries
        into sets of 800 and check these for results.
        If none are found in the first one, or the second,
        we would abandon the search claiming it's a failure.
        
        This has now been fixed.
